| April 5 | 9-10pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| Feb 25  | 11-12pm |                                                                                                                                                                                   Spent time thinking through the problem and writing notes to help me understand the problem and ideate ways to solve it. |
| Feb 27  | 9-10am  |                                                                                              Spent most of class trying to think thru and understand the idea behind checking the diagonal/(left n up). Watched and worked at the board for the majority of the class and started to fill in the 2d array. |
| Feb 28  | 11-12am | Using the notes from class and pictures of the board, i finished iterating through my board and have created the if statements for when the characters match and when they don't. However, something is wrong with the tester file and I need to ask Mr. Blick for help before being able to test my code. |
| Mar 3   |   5-6   |                                                                                                         Mr. Blick helped me fix my tester file and my initial file failed all cases and returned 0 for every test case. After some testing and changing with the code, the code passes all the test cases. |
